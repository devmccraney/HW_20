            <p>Love Me True Rescue is a nonprofit cat rescue organization. They provide a home and opportunity for adoption for cats that would otherwise be on the streets or euthanized in overcrowded shelters.
              <br><br>
              Their website was unpleasant to use and made it difficult to donate or inquire about adoption. We felt that updating the website to be more delightful for users would increase engagement, leading to more donations and adoptions.</p>

            <p>Our first instinct was to reach out to the site owner for website data and to ask her about pain points related to the site, however, she did not respond. 
            <br><br>
            Left to our own devices, we figured the best place to start was to create a proto persona. We wanted this to be our first step, to help guide us through the decision-making process moving forward through the eyes of a potential user.</p>

            <div class="col-xl">
              <p>Next, we wanted to get some preliminary data to help us prioritize the information we wanted to highlight on the site and start planning on some design choices to make the flow easy and fun to use. 
              <br><br>
              For some quantitative data, we created a survey for any Florida resident aged 18 or older on frequency of donations, adoptions, and volunteering. 
              <br><br>
              For qualitative data, we conducted user interviews, focusing on people who have interacted in any way with an NPO before, preferably via adopting an animal or donating. We wanted to learn about what factors led people to donate, adopt, volunteer, etc. and what factors deterred them from it. We wanted to connect to the emotional side of users through this, and dig deep into /why/ people choose to adopt, donate, or volunteer. </p>

              <div class="col-xl">
                <p>Our initial research yielded very enlightening information about user experience with donation and adoption in particular. 
                <br><br>
                It was quite clear from the survey that adoption was very common with our respondents. We were excited to see such a high number! But we also found a rather low donation percentage among our respondents, with barely half of them donating more than one time per year to organizations they supported.
                <br><br>
                From our interviews, we were quite surprised to find that multiple participants had previously had bad experiences with nonprofit organizations, from a lack of accountability to actually being scammed. Many of our participants felt distrust in NPOs from these past experiences and shared that they needed to do a ton of research and have a lot of reassuring information before working with them in any way. 
                <br><br>
                From these data points we knew we needed to focus on <b>honesty, transparency, and trust-building</b> to properly engage our users. </p>

              <p>To start off the defining phase, we took all of the insights gained from initial research to create a new persona that more properly represented our typical user base. 
                <br><br>
                Once we had our new persona in mind, we created an empathy map to really get into her head and get ideas on how to connect with her on an emotional level. </p>

                <div class="col-xl">
                  <p>We then created our chief problem statement based off the pain points from our interviews: 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The Love Me True Rescue NPO was designed to rescue, rehabilitate, and find safe forever homes for kittens and cats who would otherwise be euthanized or abandoned. We have observed that their website could be improved by creating a more delightful user experience, which we believe could lead users to be more interested in adoption and donation opportunities. How might we improve the design of the website to connect with users and encourage donation and adoption rates?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    At this point we began narrowing down the websiteâ€™s specific issues with a heuristic evaluation and competitor analysis. To start off the defining phase, we took all of the insights gained from initial research to create a new persona that more properly represented our typical user base.</p>

              <p>Before we started prototyping we began creating our style guide by choosing colors, fonts, icons, graphics, etc. that would all be a part of the final product. Below you can see some snippets from the style guide. We went for a very minimal but inviting red-orange and dark gray color scheme. We felt the red color evoked a call to action feel while the contrasting gray toned it down so that it wasnâ€™t too brash. We also chose fun and casual fonts, images, and icons to add some delight to the experience.

                  <p>Once our low fidelity wireframes were complete we began prototyping as well as expanding to mid and eventually high-fidelity wireframes. Due to our very short timeline we decided to only test the high-fidelity version; we knew this was a risky move in case big changes needed to be made, but for our timeline it made more sense to move forward with our style guide and bring the whole thing together. 
                    <br><br>
                    Below are our high-fidelity wireframes, with mobile and desktop versions displayed side-by-side to show our responsive design.

                      <p>Our homepage showcases our fun but simple color scheme. The simple cute images are inviting and sweet without being cheesy. The homepage clearly states our mission statement with an immediate call to action that would lead a user to a resource page to gain more information on all of our services.The text is purposely sparse to aid in scanning with low overwhelm.

                          <p>Our donation page is simple and minimal with the same inviting aesthetic. Donors can easily choose their donation frequency and amount. Each donation amount is paired with a short explanation of the exact way that the donation money will be used to uphold transparency. 
                            <br><br>
                            For our mobile version, we decided to create an accordion experience that expands as users input information and follows the screen down the page. The donation process can get lengthy with the amount of information provided and needed from the user so we did our best to ease these transitions to be seamless to keep users from getting overwhelmed.

                      <br><br>
                      We also wanted to add more call to action buttons on the mobile website, as users most often took unexpected paths to reach the adopting/donating pages during testing in the mobile version.

                      Then, of course, our next steps from that point would be to finish the rest of the website by designing a webpage for volunteering application, an About page, and a detailed contact page.
